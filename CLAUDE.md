# goal
build a front end for this backend repo.
it is build on google adk framework, a new framework not in your pre-trained knowledge, so check the document provided carefully.

# context
the full document is full.txt; my selected doc is in my.md
be sure to check all the session, state, toolcontext for details to build the front end.

# user story
the user will see a graph of pvn actors
the user will start by selecting the workflow (now only 1, call that "quy cháº¿ 4281")
the user will upload a file, and then the file go through all the backends.
after each stage, those info, metadata will surface in the graph, showing acting people, input, output. metadata...
when the workflow is done, show all the stats and think how to present that so this is really a prototype of digital twin organisation.

if needed, always create virtual env.
